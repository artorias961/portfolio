A electrical engineer who aims to evolve, innovate, and inspire through technology.

Currently, I am pursuing a graduate degree in Electrical Engineering [Cal State LA](https://www.calstatela.edu/ecst/ece), with a research focus on enhancing energy efficiency in smart environments through the application of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for occupancy detection.





<!-- Previously, I was a Eoftware Engineer at [Curebase](https://www.curebase.com) where I contributed to the creation of a decentralized clinical trial platform and scaling infrastructure with an emphasis on security, HIPAA compliance, and GDPR compliance. 

Prior to that, I worked with the Digitization Program Office (DPO) at the [Smithsonian Institution](https://www.si.edu) as a consulting Full Stack Engineer in collaboration with the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).

Outside of work, I've written more than 50 technical articles that have received over 1 million views. I've self-published two books, worked on US patents, and made contributions to open-source projects like Meta's [React Native (v0.60)](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2019/06/12/react-native-open-source-update).
