A electrical engineer who aims to evolve, innovate, and inspire through technology.

Currently, I am pursuing a graduate degree in Electrical Engineering [Cal State LA](https://www.calstatela.edu/ecst/ece), with a research focus on enhancing energy efficiency in smart environments through the application of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for occupancy detection.
