In this guide, we'll cover the process of generating a GitHub personal access token (PAT) and using it for secure authentication with Git. This method replaces the now-deprecated password authentication for Git operations over HTTPS.

## What is a Personal Access Token?

A **Personal Access Token (PAT)** is a secure alternative to using a password for GitHub authentication. It provides fine-grained control over what the token can access and is more secure than using your GitHub password for tasks such as cloning repositories, pushing changes, and accessing APIs.

## Step 1: Generating a Personal Access Token

Follow these steps to generate a personal access token:

1. **Log in to GitHub**
   - Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.

2. **Access Token Settings**
   - Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and select **Settings**.
   - In the left sidebar, click **Developer settings** > **Personal access tokens** > **Tokens (classic)**.

3. **Create a New Token**
   - Click on **Generate new token** (or **Generate new token (classic)** if using classic tokens).
   - Provide a descriptive name for the token (e.g., "Docker Pterodactyl Minecraft Server").

4. **Select Scopes**
   - Choose the appropriate scopes for your use case. For basic Git operations, select:
     - `repo`: Full control of private repositories.
     - `workflow`: Access to GitHub Actions workflows (optional).
   - Scroll down and click **Generate token**.

5. **Copy the Token**
   - Once generated, copy the token immediately as you won't be able to view it again. Store it securely (e.g., in a password manager).

6. **Generate a Token in the GitHub CLI (Optional)**
   - If you prefer to use the GitHub CLI, run:
     ```bash
     gh auth login
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to authenticate and generate a token directly in your terminal.

## Step 2: Using the Token for Authentication

### Configuring Git to Use the Token (Option A)

1. **Replace HTTPS Password with Token**
   - When performing Git operations (e.g., `git clone`, `git push`), GitHub will prompt for your username and password.
   - Use your **GitHub username** as the username.
   - Paste the **personal access token** as the password.

2. **Cache the Token Locally**
   - To avoid entering the token repeatedly, configure Git to store credentials:
     ```bash
     git config --global credential.helper store
     ```

3. **Update Repository Remote URL (Optional)**
   - Ensure your repository is set to use HTTPS:
     ```bash
     git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
     ```

### Alternative Solution: Using SSH Keys (Option B)

If you prefer SSH-based authentication instead of personal access tokens, follow these steps to set up SSH keys:

1. **Generate an SSH Key**
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
     ```
   - Press **Enter** to accept the default file location (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
   - (Optional) Set a passphrase for additional security.

2. **Add the SSH Key to GitHub**
   - Copy the public key to your clipboard:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     ```
   - Log in to GitHub and navigate to **Settings** > **SSH and GPG keys**.
   - Click **New SSH key**, paste the key, and save.

3. **Test the Connection**
   - Test your SSH key with GitHub:
     ```bash
     ssh -T git@github.com
     ```
   - You should see a success message.

4. **Update Repository Remote URL**
   - Update your repository to use SSH:
     ```bash
     git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<username>/<repository>.git
     ```

## Step 3: Securing and Managing Tokens

1. **Token Expiry**
   - Set an expiration date for your token during creation for added security. Regenerate the token as needed.

2. **Revoking Tokens**
   - If your token is compromised or no longer needed, revoke it from the **Personal access tokens** page in your GitHub settings.

3. **Storing Tokens**
   - Use a secure method to store tokens, such as a password manager or environment variables.

   Example of storing the token as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_token>
   ```

4. **Using Environment Variables in Scripts**
   - Reference the token in scripts:
     ```bash
     git clone https://$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
     ```


## Conclusion

Using a personal access token is a secure and effective way to authenticate with GitHub. Alternatively, SSH keys provide a robust option for managing secure connections. By following this guide, you'll be able to manage your repositories seamlessly while maintaining security.
