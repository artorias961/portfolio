## My Song
Universe
Uni-one Verse-song

How do you pray when many people are stabbing you? I am bleeding so much and it is hard for me to bare. I’m losing so much strength and I do not have the strength to stand up anymore. God How can I pray when I Am bleeding so much? How can I pray if all of these swords are inside of me? I want to pray to you but When I look at my chest all I see are these scars. How can I pray if it hurts so much. If I can't feel my pain anymore , how can I pray to you?
Where are my friends and family? Look God, they have abandoned me but where are you? Why are they trying to kill me? They are opening my wounds again and they did not even let my previous wounds heal. Why can’t this be a dream?
I am in a room with one door that is locked. I am starting to see water filling up. Where can I throw the water to? I will eventually drown. I waited so long and patiently . No one gave me a knock, not even once. Not once. Why won’t no one rescue me? Why can’t someone just be here? Why is it so dark?
How do you pray if your an emotionless Tool? What is my meaning? What am I?
Why am I so sad? Have you seen an abandoned dog?
How hard is it to ask for death? Why is death so beautiful ?
I walk through a desert yet there is no water or a well. I have not seen one. I have not seem a person. I’m dying.
Sometimes I think of life as a terrible nightmare. I just want to end it to wake up.
I see puzzles everywhere on the floor. People pushing and destroying it each time I’m close to finish. Is this reality?
What is motivation? I hear no one or see anyone. Can the sun rise? It is dark, the wind thrashes at me and does not let me.
How do you achieve motivation if your losing blood? When wounds don’t heal. Only the least expected came to my rescue. The important people never bother to help truly. Yet finding the least expected is impossible. Why did she have to die if only they would listen to my voice.
Sometimes in life my voice doesn't matter to the world. How will I contribute to this world , this song.
All I ever wanted was to be recognized. Not by words but meaning.
Everything started to change at college. How come I had to wait 19 years to find these people. The amount of pain I had to endure. I had to be quiet for so long. Why 19 years. Who heard my cry ?
Who got me out of his nightmare. who save me from this island.
I’m all bottled up and yet they accept me. While others didn’t consider me.
When I help the, they thank me but when I needed help no one was their. 19 years it took. Why did it take so long. Why I had to be beaten up for no reason?
My past haunted me so much.
My past affects my daily life. The past prevents me from doing anything.
Why does a video game/movie can demonstrate how I feel ?
Why do I exist ? What is my passion? What is my dream? What is my talent?
Lately something has been bothering me. My past does not affect me anymore. I care not for my parents as I should. However, something still bothers me. I lost my passion, I don’t feel anything, I feel like an outcast. How do you communicate if you don’t speak the same language?
Wherever I go I’m always an outsider. Looking for a place to rest before .
I mainly go to school because of my sister other than that I really don’t care for my life as much. I tried to care for myself but I see it as a burden.
God how come when I walk to a beautiful park . Everyone is happy and in joy. However, when I go to the pond and see the reflection of myself. It is barely visible.
What do you do when you have so much money and money does not satisfied you?
My heart is broken... I have no faith in myself but everything else I kinda do... I’m drowning... who will rescue me?
Why do I hate myself so much? Everyone else wants to be like me for some reason. People call me a rare friend. Yet I found myself hating the way I am. People tell me I’m smart but they do not know the burden I went through as a child. I had to endure. I had a few things that sustain me. My sister , math , and 1 more thing.
Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I don’t exist at all. I would be helping a lot of people.
I’m tired of climbing this mountain. So many snakes and rats . Many sharp trees, branches, and rocks. My bruises ache so much. I just want to give up.
Who can tell my fake smile from a real smile? I have found no one God. Not one can tell when I am in a terrible storm. Everyone is to focus on themselves . How can God be with me if Bella is dead. I looked for you and I couldn’t find you. Why are you invincible ? There are times when I need someone. Usually 99 percent of the time I suffer alone. Why don’t you answer ? Why do you sleep during the storm? You promise. I’m drowning and I can’t take it anymore. With what strength can I move this boat? There is no one here. So I’ll ask again. Who in this earth can tell when I’m good or when I’m faking to be good? Who can read this heart? What I learn in this storm, the greatest obstacle is myself. I need someone. How long will this boat will last?
I am not good enough to be saved. I row the boat so much. I Been rowing and rowing. I am tired . I had enough. I see no one who cares for me not a bit. They talk but their actions say otherwise. The only favor I can ask for is to get rid of this feeling. I wouldn’t say this if I couldn’t take it anymore. It been years of rowing. The storm is getting fiercer .
Why is it easier to pray anything else but when I pray about this feeling It does not goes away. I give up.
Water to wine. Change nothing into something. Change water that was common into rich colorful tasteful wine.
When I was young, my parents would make fun of me. They would call me names but they physical/mentally abuse me, it would hurt not as much of being me.
I don’t have a gift and I don’t know why people say I do have a gift .
I’m alone and nothing feels like home.
Who is patiently to help me and will not give up on me? For I have given up on myself.
I have to get out. I have to leave this house. Whenever I’m here I’m always put down. No encouraging words at all. I hate this. I need to live. I need freedom. I been here long enough . I just need air to breathe.
Why am I so sad? I can’t be happy or in peace. No matter how much I pray I still feel worthless. Why is cry not answer ? How much longer do I have to endure. If this keeps going, eventually, I will get tired of this feeling.
I want to change but how? I have no passion or motivation in me. Everyone took that away from me. I try to call out for my dream but no one answered. I yelled throughout the streets but in return people laugh at me . I cry for my passion but no one came to hug me. I am drowning who will rescue me from this madness ? If I let go I wonder what would have happened?
Do I believe anyone will rescue me? I want to say yes but my heart tells me no. My heart tells me to express myself but I am too afraid. I do not want to get hurt again. My heart aches. My heart wants someone to hear my cry and defend me from my accusers. My heart wants to believe I’m worth something at least one coin but it does not think it is worth even that. Years ago, My heart cry out to everyone but no one listens.
My voice has no impact to the world. My voice does not feel accounted to anything.
People tell me grow up and stop making excuses . My response to them is this, if you were my situation you would have understood this feeling but since your to conceded to look at my wounds then leave me be.
My accusers who consider themselves friends but are back stabbers . Those who are fake to me and does not help me in time of need. Have you ever consider an ant. Do you stop at look at an ant. Do you let the ant pass by then you walk. Of course not , you would walk through and would not even care for the. Tell me who is the ant? Do you want to know how many people did not wait for the ant?
I have to tend to my own wounds. I do not know how to. No matter what type of medicine I use it still hurts. What medicine can heal this hole in my heart ?
It is best to give my friends personal space from me. I feel an annoyance to them.
When I was in my darkness moment. I cried at one last time. I cry to God, I told him my pain . He rescued me. He saved me from my enemies. He comforts me. He wanted to share a meal with me , he insisted. He restored me, gave me a place to rest. He told me it was just a storm. The storm comes but it passes by, Some storms last a little and some last for a long time.



Individual
Educational
Plan

During middle school, I gave up on school. My school has given me a label and I could not cope with it . School lost my interest. My parents did not support me. My friends did not support me. Teachers consider me a lost. I started to give up in my dream, my passion, and my motivation. Yet Bella was their. She would always come in the perfect time of need. Bella gave me the support I needed. I passed all my classes with high scores and the dean was touch. The dean saw me improving. She made the whole class clap for me and said let’s clap for him because he is passing. I passed eighth grade. I went to high-school as well as my IEP.
I enroll to my classes and was placed in the advanced class, however, I was the only freshman in every period while other students where senior or junior level. Surprisingly, everyone asks me for help and I did my best. I never did homework for math. I always wonder why the IEP student? Why ask me for help?
My first IEP meeting came and the first thing my math teacher said to my counselor, IEP counselor, dean, and my parents . Mr Kirr said “ Your kid is smart. He does not do any homework but he is acting every test.”. I remember all my counselor did not said a word or my parents . After the meeting my math teacher put 100 percent for all the missing homework. He said at least try to do homework next time. I had him for 2 years and a half years. The other semester I had a math Russian women teacher. Everything she taught me I knew another way to solve it . She did not accept it and told me I need to do her way. That was the first time my IEP counselor defended me. She made sure I switch back to kirr.
During senior year I lost motivation to do anything. The head of department of math did not like me. He assumed I cheated like the other IEP students. I did not bother to argue with him at all. While the cheaters failed the test and ask him for a retake. Also giving them the answers but with me he did not help me at all. How was that fair ? I gave up on the class because this was not fair for me.
I never used IEP for anything. My IEP counselor would try me to put me in slow math classes but I refuse. I prove them wrong. The first 3 years I always finish my test first or second then wait 30 minutes for everyone else . Yet I aced the test.
I pass high-school Interestingly enough my parents black,Ali me to walk on stage. I hate parties. So why will I go to my graduation. My stem counselor saw me insisted to give me 500 dollars for prom and Disney but I refuse kindly. She said if you don’t want to walk on stage then let me know. I was afraid to tell her so I said thank you very much.
I got accepted to 2 universities and got rejected to all cal states. My IEP counselor laugh and said I probably made a minor mistake. He told me since I had IEP on me and tookenn difficult classes . I making a name for myself.
He told me not to worry. You will do great in life. He is not worried about me but the other IEP students he is scared of.
Surprisingly, I got phone calls from the university and said they would like to work with me and get me a scholarship but I gladly decline. I started to talk to other people and find myself in an interview for a scholarship. I pass the first interview then I needed another interview and I pass that one to. Mr. William vine told me go to community college first . He told the first year is to prove them(DOR) if I’m good investment. It hurled but at least he is straightforward . He told me I could attend to a university but they would only give me community college money. After one year of college, Vine was surprise and Ruben (William supervisor) congratulated me. William vine has cancer and he stop attending to work. Ruben wanted to have an interview with me. I was scared and frightened but he welcomed me with open hands. He said I impressed him. He said let get me a laptop. We talked about my laptop and future plans. He said good job and don’t give up yet. Your closer than you know.
After that I took a calculus 1 boot camp. The professor was head of department of math. He is not slow and merciful but he can teacher very good. I remember we finish algebra in one day, trigonometry in two day, calculus 1 in 5 weeks , and calculus 2 chapter 7 in two days. I pass every exam with an A but the last one ,however, I had the highest score 61%. So Kavanai dropped the last test. The class was mad because someone keeps getting A’s in every exam. Who ever has the highest score that is considered a 100 percent so... yeah lol.
He was impressed and said good job. I should be in his class he told me. You already know.
When he said that , it made me very happy and relieved. No one has ever said that to me. An IEP student that was struggling all the time and got a wonderful response. Encouraging words to my heart.
Now I’m waiting for my fall 2018 class. I’m taking calculus 3 , physics 102, and differential equations. I honestly thought I would have never made it. I’m so afraid of taking these classes. Especially physics 102.
Currently I’m taking a NASA undergraduate at LACC and a Fullerton internship. The people know about my anxiety for public speaking. They laugh and said do not worry about it you have us.
Why did I deserve all of this? I know someone else needs this more than me. So why me?
It was a long journey but I believe I can conclude my book soon. I have no idea what else to do.
I ask myself over and over will I ever change? Will God ever change me? I believe in God but I can not have any faith he will change me. I feel handcuffed to myself again. I’m afraid to express myself. I wonder if I ever will leave here. I honestly feel worthless even though I accepted God. I do not want to be here. I know no one wants to hear my voice because everyone is focus on themselves. How come people at church do not approach me but people at school approach me? How come people at school welcome me with open hands and yet at church I feel they despise me. Why is people sacrifice their own time to talk to me at school but people at church are not willingly. How come I must start the conversation at church? I hate it.
Yes people at church are more cruel but they are more true to me. Honestly they do not lash at me. When I was depressed they comfort me. I wonder why? I thought the Bible said each of us must help a brother out in need. How come if I need help I have to talk to people at church but school when I need help they are their. Yes they act how they act and sometimes I get very uncomfortable but they accept me for who I am.
They watch every action I do. Everything I do it is in their record. However, at church people judge me by the cover. I act the same at church when I am at school. What confuses me the most, I do not understand this at all. How come it took many months to people to approach me? I’m anti social. How come at my internship they help me with my anti social but at church they just sit their. If I do anything at church I feel I will be judge way more than I should.
Sometimes I feel an outcast to the church. Anyone who speaks English only will understand.
I’m still at a loss for words. Whenever I leave god he does not stop. He keeps on going . He went out to get my attention. Not even once he made fun of me but help me .
My friends called this love but how?
I bought my sister a cyan pencil bag. Inside their was cyan eraser, cyan very fine pen, black fountain pen , Sakura cyan pen, more cyan pen, cyan brush pen, and a cyan lead pencil. Everything was imported from Japan. I want her to have a future not a nightmare. I don’t want her to live what I live.
There is one more set I want to buy her. A set I’m thinking about getting a specific teacher involved.
Why doesn’t god just leave me be? Why does he keep on persisting? Why can’t he act like a human being?
Again and again and again why can’t I connect with my parents at all. Whenever I want to express myself they shun me down. When I speak to someone else they always hear me talk. Even I bother that person he does not get mad. I honestly think of as a father than a friend. A person that I needed when I was young.
Why do I feel so useless even though my day have been so great. I just get home I feel all this guilt of myself but whenever I leave my guilt is gone. I go looking through the house and can’t find anything. I want to truly live. I need to leave this place for good. Instead of being a resting place I feel like a prisoner.
Everything that my family member said to me was wrong... everyone in my school say the opposite ... so much warmth they bring to my hurt. Slowly but surely all the labeling is leaving me. I hate having the IEP . I hate that I’m retarded but people say I’m smart ? Why does not the words of others hurt less -than being me. Why being me makes me feel so sad?
C4 once said lying tears hurts others, a lying smile hurts oneself
It’s funny when you family cry’s of Bella death but I did not. I warned them for months did they listen to me ? No. Yet they are crying and telling me to cry when I told them it is not my fault is it .
I have been wanting to leave a message for my sister to move on before I go. I can not find anyone to help her.
Happiness where have you gone ? Why have you left me? Passion where have you gone? My motivation is gone.


Scars were the only thing I received from them. Scars are my only fond memories.
I have a gaping hole in me. I’m just so damage. It feels like I’m going to be swallowed by its emptiness . I can’t compete Loneliness. I can’t compete with myself . I am not strong. I don’t know who I am. Don’t make me go away
Is their someone inside of me ?
How do you teach a peach seed to become a mango tree
One day a person died but no one mourn fir him. They all pass by him. Not even his family. Yet the wind gave him flowers.
I am forgotten , no one will remember me .
No one truly cared about me.
I have to let go





In the mirror

What do you do if a sword piece your heart?
You cry or try to forget the pain ? Is it like closing a door a room filled with water. Why are people so cruel. Human thinks physical weapons hurt and yet they don't seem to understand Words are stronger. I might be conceited about this point of view but I stop caring a long time ago. Is it possible to become an emotionless tool? I suppose not .
What's the point of living if I'm so bored and everything does not make me happy. Haha I have a crappy life. Would anyone understand this probably but everyone to focus about their own things.
How long can I hold the door before the door breaks and I'll be submerged with my pain.
Why am I so quiet you ask ? Simple. Look at an abandoned dog.
Do you look at an ant? When you are walking do you ever consider the ant you about to step on or do you wait and let the ants go wherever about ?
Is it fear that bother me. Maybe. Do I ever want to kill myself. Yes. Why ? Cause I'm bored and what is the point for me just going to college but I have no meaning. Not even a spark to live on.
Does Grace truly exist in the world? How can grace get rid of it? How can grace solve it?
After seeing my dog vomit blood that's when my heart became heart of stones. Losing everything. When I kept warning them but they never lesson. Who is my encourager know ?
How much longer do I have to look at this wound? Why am I alive? Killing myself sounds boring but living bores me to death. Why? Why do I keep coming to this solution? I have I given up in life that much? Haha being bottle up sucks a lot.
What has my imprinting learning of foundation have become.
What is love from human standards? Is the human eye that looks for love? Most likely. Why don't we use the heart to search for love ?
Probably this is a foolish thing to say all of this but a room filled with water can't be held that much longer.
I ask myself how come someone or something just kill me because suicide is still "killing" some one.
What will happen if I go back in time and change something? Wouldn't the whole world be different because every action has a reaction.
Princess EA once said would you rather have a pain that leads to success or a life of being haunted with regret.
"Trying gets in a way of doing " my math teacher keeps saying.
That's all I do try.
"Would you die for your mother ?" Nope I will not because it is ungrateful for me to die. When my mother spent her life raising me. If I got to her mindset. She prefers herself to die instead of me.
I wonder why did god actually put the Tree Of Life in the garden of Edom. Knowingly what could happen. Is it to make a point with the devil? Or he wanted true people but he put the bad to deep sleep.
What does the fruit actually mean?
Why do I make life so boring? Everything I talk to or touch I lose interest. I ask myself is death actually beautiful . Probably if I actually truly lived.
Looking at a dark room sucks very bad. What is there to look at if I can't even see in the first place.
It's interesting how prince ea explains words can break bones. It can even shattered a dream.
Most People judge the cover but they actually don't even try to read the glossary. Is it respect? Afraid? Don't want to waste time? Or is it the imagery of the book?
Someone ask me what's worse breaking couple of your bones or breaking your spirit? If I think of physical pain then yes it will but only temporarily. However, breaking your spirit could make you lost?
Is wisdom silent? Whenever someone tells me argument that they want to establish my life. I found out that staying silent will end the discussion quicker. Is wisdom quiet ?
What good can a wavy water reflection do if everything so blurry?
Someone asked me how come I didn't get mad when someone damage my car. Knowing that "Mercedes" cost so much. I just said why get mad when it happen already. I'll just be wasting my time and effort for being mad. And yet they insisted why I don't get mad.
I hate how my parents discourage me what I do even though they don't mean it. They say something bad in general but don't say exactly what. Even do I know what they mean but it gets annoying of it.
Is it better to be blind? Everything I have seen is terrible. War breeds war. Solving a problem brings more problems.
It's very funny that we all say slavery does not exist but it does. Some people just can't see the mastermind of money can do. If there was no money or currency at all. Everybody won't be working. But since money has "value", that "value" somehow goes into the mind and make them a slave.
I'm starting to understand what love is. As I keep watching and listening to what the apostle keep saying about us youth. We must have value in Christ no matter what.
I learn that if I have to the poor but didn't love them I am nothing. So I'm nothing then even though I'm trying my best to understand it.
I like how the pastor keeps saying how Jesus loves us but if I don't know how to love in nothing. The pastor keeps saying he loves us, read the Bible God loves us and he sent his only son to die on the cross for us. But I feel nothing.
I finally found a quote how that makes me somewhat understand what the church is talking about. "Love is just a word until you give it meaning"
How do I give love a meaning to it?
Faith makes a fool what makes sense then
I nearly killed myself with 12M HCl
Depression feels like drowning while I watch others breathing
I’m in my Celeste mountain, in the mirror. Why is it so painful and dark.
Will there be a light that can finally save me.
Saying hello but people ignore you. The sad part is, it’s at church.
People at school accept me who I am more at school. Puzzle as always. Why do I meet nice people at school than at church.
Sadly at church people judge what you do on the outside not what you can contribute. They look more into the past.
How do you pray when your stab and bleeding to death. When my wounds heal I starting to see my scar. It hurt so bad.
What the point in living.
I can’t contribute in this world. I can’t help others.
Why is my mindset so negative. Why I can’t be happy at least 1 minute. Why can’t I sleep in peace. Why do I want to die so bad. Why do I feel so alone. Why am I like this.
Why do people have to bring me down. It hurts so bad.
I feel like I dragging people and I’m a hassle to them.
If this pain keeps continuing surely I will kill myself. It’s hard to live in this life.
I been observing at church and school. Surprisingly at school people show love by their actions. It’s been helping me a lot. When I go to church, the people main speak Spanish. They don’t even try the effort to say hi to me. Apparently I’m to serious but at school people say hi to me no matter what. How can I be lifted up if I feel like an abandoned dog.
Lately in my dreams everyone is against me.
When I feel so depressed my dog always come even though I don’t call her. When I dint pay attention, she will get my attention.
Will I ever find peace .
Interestingly enough. Each time I type here, my heart beat raises.
Sometimes I wish someone could kill me. According to the Bible, whoever gets Roy the temple ], god will destroy him. So I can’t kill myself.
Water to wine.
Nothing into something.
Something so common into something so rich.
I still can’t find rest.
I want to talk but I’m afraid of being hurt again.
I finally met someone who I like.
When I look at my past,
What’s my gift in life.
When I’m not with my
Is it wrong to want death. Is it wrong that I keep wanting to die.
I feel nothing. Not even the slightest passion. I can not find what will make me happy. I have no strength. I have no courage. It feels like I will always be stuck in this cage. It feels like I don’t have a gift. It feels like I can’t contribute to life. It feels like salt that has lost its flavor. What is the point of salt if it does nothing at all. It just there, taking space and name.
Sometimes I wonder why I’m like this. I want a true friend. I need someone. I need someone to watch over my sister . Someone needs to be her role model when I’m gone.
I wonder why I exist in this universe. I can’t contribute to this song. I feel like giving up. I feel unwanted. Bothering people space and time. If I have the power to erase, I would erase myself.
Why can’t I socialize with other people at church but at school I feel more accepted. Why is it at school people approach me than at church. Why the people at school willingly to share their time with me. Their are some people at church that can pass through my facial expression.
When will my book start. I’m not good in anything.
Only a little love can mean the whole world,to me. A love that is patience and does not judge me. Luke 15 for example
Forgiveness. Why am I supposed to do in life. I feel like I have no purpose. Why do I want to die so bad. Is this depression. Why was I beat up , mentally abuse, and feel abandoned. So many questions I have. When will I find peace and love. Who will save me in this terror. 1 Corinthians 13 describe love Does not keep a record of wrongdoing.
I keep wondering and wondering why am i still alive. Why can’t I just die in piece.

“Your blind of what you need”


You might be wondering why I am writing this all down. To be honest I do not know why either. Probably when I die someone can have an idea? Probably to get people's attention ? Or just to write it down? You choose.
I am starting to understand at church I do not fit in with anyone. No matter how hard I tried to talk to people I can not seem to connect with other people. Same thing with my family, I can not connect with them at all. Whenever I tried to talk to them they always have something to say or they would not listen to me. At school I found the rarest friends. Who do actually try to support me.

How come when I am having a good day but inside of me, someone telling me I’m useless. I am not going to make it through life. This voice over rides me through every decision. No matter what I do, that voice is speaking. Any test, driving, church, school, passion, hobby, video games, books,.... no matter what I do that voice is there. That voice brings me down. I remember all the tests I have taken for math. People say I am smart but I am not. Each time I take my math test, during the test, that voice tells me I’m going to fail. When I received my test. Every professor smiles at me and says good job. I received an A. Yet, that voice tells me, your book smart. Who will want a book smart person.
This voice kills me so much. If I did not have this voice, I will be free. I will feel no one is holding me back.
It is sad to see the biggest obstacle of my life is myself. This obstacle almost killed me twice actually. It might happen again but I might lose this time.
Everything else is meaningless. If I can not fight my biggest obstacle how can I express myself? How can I tell others of how I overcome this obstacle.
No matter where I go. The voice is their.
I am so lucky to have friends to encourage me. No matter what I am going through they are their. Without them I would have not made it.
Everyone thinks I’m strong but in reality I’m crying inside. I’m weak, I’m afraid, I’m scared to do anything.
I do not mind to fail but what actually scares me is staying at failure. Not learning from failure scares me the most. Staying at rock bottom.

This is why I stay quiet
I want to quit so bad
I do not know what is my dream anymore

I never heard the words from my parents or family say to me, I believe in you.
Did you know the smallest amount of love can be the greatest treasure for a child.
Love has a catch to it though. Love can not be said in words but have to be proven by your action.

You were deeply hurt, huh? So deeply that one normally wouldn’t be able to recover.

I learned in life big achievements mean nothing. What matters the most are the small matter. The Blue butterfly effect

Is this where I will die ?
Why does it keep staring at me?

It is hard to forgive years and years of mental/physical abuse. I see one of my parents trying to change but stills likes to hold on to the past. His action tells me otherwise. My mother just gave or never bother to change. I have a sister to take care of. Everything I do she will do. They are no support to us, they will bring us down in a few days or in a week. Why communicate with them if they bring her down so much.
When I tell my parents of my achievement they say they are proud but their action seems like usual. They are not surprise at all.
My sister likes to do her painting but my parents won’t get her one of the best material. She shows the passion but people keep bringing her down. To choose a different major. Apparently, money more important than a passion/gift. I keep telling my sister to do art. I bought her one of the best paint just for her. I’m encouraging her to do what she loves but she keeps being shut down. She won’t open to me. Why do I have to be the oldest? It is hard to be something that you are not to . A peach seed can’t grow up to be an orange tree. It is impossible. I don’t want no one to determine her success.
Will I sing praise to you God.

Sadly I am easily to get stress at the smallest things. I easily get depression and it sucks. However, I keep everything to myself.

I still wonder to this day what motivate me to type all of this. It seems like I’m repeating some stuff.



The more I see you. The more I cherish you.

Who will hear my song?
I know I speak the truth
This is my song,
Nameless


I am always curious why I am not successful but my doctor told me I am success according to her. I am lost and confused. I am sad and lost all of my passion. I give up. I can’t take it anymore. I hate what I am doing. I hate every ounce of it. Their is no beautiful ending here.


Why is god testing me? Haven’t I suffer enough already? Aren’t my scars more than enough of proof to show. I’m about to be broken again and I haven’t glue all the prices yet. Why is everything falling apart.
Despite all of this, I have not fallen into anger. I have not lash out to anyone. I even gave food to the homeless when I had nothing. Why am I being tested?
What did I do to deserve this?

I am in pain. I have been stab by multiple weapons. I’m losing blood everywhere and I can’t stop and aid all the deep cuts. God where are you? Won’t you help me? I feel I beyond rescue, who would heal me ?




What is sad that I can understand people but everyone could never understand me. Imagine having so many friends but in the inside you are all alone. Dark. Forgotten. Lost. Alone. “Sometimes I feel like a caretaker for a museum, a huge, empty museum. Where no ever comes and I’m watching it over for no one”

Despite all of this, I have finally found someone I can cry too. I’m comforted despite of my scars. Someone hears my cries!!! All of these years, of pain and misery. Have been worth it, I feel happy, validated, in peace, and love.
You did not left me, when I needed you the most!!! Even when I tried to push you, you stayed!!!

I was alone all my life and I accepted this would be my entire life. But she is starting to break my foundation. Destroying what’s holding me back, the bandages I put on to hide the scars. She accepts it, my heart is warmth

Someone has tame the beast!!!

If I told my younger self this, younger me would have laugh and mocked me for creating a false fantasy. For someone who is willingly to hear me and my story. Brings me to so much tears and joy!

Why do I trust her so much? I’m not so sure but inside tells me sit here and rest. She always say “thank you for telling me” but that phrase always confuses me but I should not think much of it. I found someone who would listen to me and not attack me.

The storm has pass, the ocean is silent. The waves have calmed. The thunders has stop roaring through the sky. The raging winds have became still. I’m at peace. Idk what to do with this burning feeling.

Because of her I am able to share my song with others.

No one was willingly as her to stay by me. To find me in the abyss and waited patiently. When she found me, she came with peace and comforting words.

If she hasn’t have come, I would have escape a nightmare dream in an instant.







I would say this, everyday I always have the idea of killing myself. Including my dreams. When I wake up, I would be sad that I’m alive. When I go to sleep, I pray for my death. I give fake smiles and laughs to everyone to show that I’m fine. I been doing this all my life but suddenly this year I couldn’t keep it together. I started to fall apart and couldn’t maintain anything.

I’m not normally happy, joyful, or at peace with myself. When I look at the mirror, I just hear all the voices what people have told me. I’m worthless, taking up space, a failure, meant to be in jail like my uncles, etc. Whenever I look at my projects, I was not happy with none of them. However, I did recall one project I do keep close to me and somewhat proud. I pleaded to my boss to teach me Linux. I gave up summer. It was the first time I felt genuine happy for myself but knowing me. The voices would come back and I start to feel terrible.

Everyone that I encounter, told me I’m smart and a good person. But I can’t see that. They keep saying good things will happen to me. That I will have a very lucky partner in the future. A well deserve partner. I waited patiently and still have no one. I refuse to date for fun or go to parties. I refuse to do drugs. I refuse so many things. I treat people fair and good as possible. But I’m always treated like trash. Karma always finds a way to make my life worst. The thing is, I don’t tell anyone about it. I just vibe about it.

As life goes on, faculties started to say, I’m a good kid and work hard. But I don’t see it.

I started to lose interest in eating, playing games, manga, reading, and any hobby I like doing when I got my bachelors. I met new people who are good but they have bad habits. Like when you are down, they make you feel like trash but they don’t do it on purpose. But when you need support you feel worst.

I normally don’t have fun days despite me looking happy. I do try my best to be around good people and change my mindset/environment. But that doesn’t help. I tried new hobbies such as hiking, shopping, adventuring, road trip, etc. All of this is for not.

Everything I wanted to do in life, I have already done. The reason why I’m still alive is a promise I made with my grandpa. Before he died, he said don’t drop out of school and be the first to get a degree. The thing about my family: they are gang banger, drug addicts, killers in the family, abusers, etc. Also that time my dad almost killed me.
I didn’t even know my grandpa that well. But he knows how my dad/mom use to beat me up. Sometimes he would see my with bruises/scars. Anyways, when my grandpa went to dialysis, nobody from the family would pick him up. He had about 13 kids and including a bunch of grandkids. I would pick him up and never ask for a single dime from him. That little time we had, we bonded.
When my grandpa passed away, I just saw everyone fighting for the money.
I know I’m not wanted or care from the family but I do my best to shield my sister.
The thing is, I’m not liked both of my family members. They would say so much stuff about me. When I got my degree they pretended like nothing ever happen. I’m the black sheep of the family and my sister can confirm it. I had to fight like hell to prove my worth.
Anyways, I was planning to kill myself on my birthday when I receive my master degree cause I fulfilled every wish list todo and satisfy the promise I made. I just don’t have that much emotions to share or have nothing interesting to say.

One of the worst pain I felt recently is when I’m in a room surrounded by friends. Then my stalker comes by and I ask for help. When you ask help to the person who closest to you, just laughs at you. Then share you plea to everyone else while laughing. Is a stab in the back. Like I was expecting to be backstab by other people but you of all people?

I don’t mean anything in a bad or negative way. But this is how I truly feel and I think it’s normal for me.

This is my song.

I wrote most of my songs when I’m depress. The last short bits of my song, was the first time I wrote my song when I’m happy. Bless her for being the support that I need and don’t deserve. Despite not knowing her at all, she comforted me
